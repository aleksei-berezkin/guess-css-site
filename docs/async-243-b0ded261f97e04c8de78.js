Time Zone Database\\n\\n      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\\n    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\\n    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\\n    Database section 7.\\n\\n     # 7.  Database Ownership\\n     #\\n     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\\n     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\\n     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\\n     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\\n     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\\n     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\\n     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\\n     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\\n     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\\n     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\\n     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\\n     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\\n     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\\n\\n    6.

Time Zone Database\\n\\n      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\\n    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\\n    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\\n    Database section 7.\\n\\n     # 7.  Database Ownership\\n     #\\n     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\\n     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\\n     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\\n     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\\n     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\\n     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\\n     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\\n     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\\n     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\\n     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\\n     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\\n     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\\n     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\\n\\n    6.

At\\n    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\\n    Compiled form of the Package.\\n\\n    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\\n    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\\n    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\\n    will be subject to the Original License.\\n\\n    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\\n\\n    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\\n    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\\n    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\\n    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\\n    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\\n    you do at least ONE of the following:\\n\\n        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\\n        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\\n        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\\n        Version.\\n\\n        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\\n        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\\n        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\\n        from the name of the Standard Version.\\n\\n        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\\n        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\\n        under\\n\\n            (i)  the Original License or\\n\\n            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\\n            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\\n            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\\n            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\\n            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\\n            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\\n            Fees are allowed.\\n\\n    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\\n    or Modified Versions without the Source\\n\\n    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\\n    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\\n    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\\n    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\\n    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\\n    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\\n    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\\n    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\\n    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\\n\\n    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\\n    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\\n    the Source of the Modified Version.\\n\\n    Aggregating or Linking the Package\\n\\n    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\\n    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\\n    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\\n    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\\n    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\\n    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\\n    as included in the aggregation.\\n\\n    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\\n    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\\n    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\\n    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\\n    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\\n\\n    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\\n\\n    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\\n    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\\n    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\\n    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\\n    terms of this license.\\n\\n    General Provisions\\n\\n    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\\n    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\\n    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\\n    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\\n    license.\\n\\n    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\\n    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\\n    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\\n    this license.\\n\\n    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\\n    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\\n\\n    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\\n    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\\n    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\\n    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\\n    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\\n    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\\n    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\\n    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\\n    date that such litigation is filed.\\n\\n    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\\n    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \\"AS\\n    IS\' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.
